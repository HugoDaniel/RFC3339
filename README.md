=======

This started out as a simple project to parse and display time according to
[RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), but with time gained ability
to convert to and from other RFCs as well.

You will find a change log in `CHANGES.md`.


### Todos

- Get rid of the `formatTime` function, and use a more decent pretty
  printing lib.
- Do some proper parsing (it parses nicely, but this was just a quick hack
  that my mind produced while being stressed to finish this).


### License

This project is licensed under a 3-clause BSD license as specified in the
